        <h2>Solution to aquaponics farms in urban locations</h2>
        <p>Creating an aquaponics market within our cities will result in savings of food crops. The treatment of fishery effluents needs to be considered when planning aquacultural production systems.However, it may be important to treat the nutrients in aquaculture effluents because the total nutrient mass loading can contribute significantly to environment degradation, depending on the quality of receiving water.
            According to the current discourse, this involves an increase in productivity and resourse use efficiency, solutions for small holder farmers, as well as reduction in food waste.The primary benefits of aquaponics are the environmentally responsible with low water usage and low power usage, increased plant growth rates and smaller production footprint than soil.</p>
        
        <h2>Impact of aquaponics farms in urban locations </h2>
        <p>A combination of plant production and fish farming in closed aquaponic systems result in a significant reduction on the environmental impact. Aquaponic systems can be operated almost waste-free; therefore, they have no measurable effects on the soil if no new area is consumed for installing aquaponics.
